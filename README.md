# Tetris Project

This project is a Tetris game implemented on the Arduino Nano, displayed on a 32x8 LED matrix display, and controlled using 4 buttons. It allows players to play the classic Tetris game, where they need to arrange falling blocks to create complete rows and clear them from the board.

## Features

- Falling blocks with different shapes and colors.
- Ability to rotate and move the blocks.
- Score tracking and level progression.
- Game over condition when the blocks reach the top of the board.

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Connect the Arduino Nano to the 32x8 LED matrix display and 4 buttons.
4. Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

## Usage

- Use the buttons to move the blocks left, right, or down.
- Press a button to rotate the blocks.
- Clear as many rows as possible to earn points and level up.
